# Layered Web Design
A Layered Web Design (LWD) template

LWD is a new methodology for creating one-page websites, specifically targeting small businesses and startups that need only static websites with limited content. In the code, the site is essentially a one-page website, but visually it looks like a multi-page website with many of the common features of a website (navigation patterns, menu links, separate "pages", etc.). You can think of it as a hybrid app/website.

Built on HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript (jQuery in my case) these small apps provide the look and feel of an app or website in the small package of a one-page website. There are many benefits to this method of website design, including:

- A faster, lighter website for the user to download
- Leaner code for developers
- Only basic Javascript is needed to create transitions
- Less taxing on servers and user data plans
- Provides the perception of speed for users
- Provides an app-like experience without having to create an app
- Grounds the user in a familiar design patter (and reduces scrolling)
